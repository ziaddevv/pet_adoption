# 🐾 Pet Adoption System - Java OOP Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Pet Adoption System** is a Java-based application designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It simulates the workflow of a pet shelter, allowing users to manage pets, adopters, and adoption records through an intuitive **console-based interface**.

## Features
- 🐶 **Pet Management**: Add and categorize pets (dogs, cats, etc.)
- 👨‍👩‍👧 **Adopter Registration**: Store and manage adopter details
- 🔄 **Adoption Matching**: Assign pets to adopters based on availability
- 📄 **Pet Listings**: Display both available and adopted pets
- ❌ **Automatic Updates**: Remove pets from availability once adopted
- ✅ **Record Keeping**: Maintain adoption history for transparency

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Java  
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- **Concepts Implemented**:
  - Classes & Objects  
  - Inheritance & Polymorphism  
  - Encapsulation & Abstraction  
  - Collections Framework (**ArrayList**, HashMap, TreeSet)  
  - File Handling for persistence *(optional)*

## Key Highlights
- Built with **15+ interconnected classes** demonstrating robust OOP design.  
- Leveraged **Collections** for efficient data management and retrieval.  
- Applied **real-world problem-solving** by simulating a shelter workflow.
